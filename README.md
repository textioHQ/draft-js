## Textio: How to Deploy

### Deploying From Master
1. Go to the `release` branch locally
2. Make sure it's up-to-date by running a `git pull --rebase`
3. Run `npm run rev`
4. Note the version number output. This is the same version number that CircleCI will deploy to npm. You can use this to update the `package.json` of a project that relies on this component
5. You're done!

### Deploying Beta Versions
Sometimes we need to deploy potentially unstable versions of editor for testing or deploying to topic branches. To do that, please:
1. Start from whatever branch you want to cut a beta version of
2. Run `npm run revbeta`
3. Note the version hash output, which looks like `v1.2.3-my-branch-name.1`. This is the same version number that CircleCI will deploy to npm. You can use this to update the `package.json` of a project beta that relies on this component

*IMPORTANT: Make sure you don't merge your beta package.json version back into master - that's up to all of us to catch in the PR*

## Important Note

We currently prepare for a 2.0 beta. The `master` branch already contains these features. All the packages are already published with a beta tag. Install it via `$ npm install <plugin>@2.0.0-beta5 --save`

Draft.js is a JavaScript rich text editor framework, built for React and
backed by an immutable model.

- **Extensible and Customizable:** We provide the building blocks to enable
the creation of a broad variety of rich text composition experiences, from
simple text styles to embedded media.
- **Declarative Rich Text:** Draft.js fits seamlessly into
[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) applications,
abstracting away the details of rendering, selection, and input behavior with a
familiar declarative API.
- **Immutable Editor State:** The Draft.js model is built
with [immutable-js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/), offering
an API with functional state updates and aggressively leveraging data persistence
for scalable memory usage.
